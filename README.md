The 2018 Data Science Bowl offers our most ambitious mission yet: create an algorithm to automate nucleus detection.

Diseases like cancer, heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Alzheimer’s, and diabetes. Many have seen their loved ones pass away. Think how many lives would be transformed if cures came faster.

By automating nucleus detection helps unlock cures faster—from rare disorders to the common cold.<br>

**Problem statement**<br>
To build a machine learning model that can identify a range of nuclei across varied conditions.
